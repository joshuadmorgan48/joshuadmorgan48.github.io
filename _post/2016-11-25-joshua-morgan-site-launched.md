This is my first blog. Today, I drove from San Felipe Pueblo to Santa Fe. The police turned on their siren near I-25 and Cerrillos Rd. 
Interchange. I pulled over and they went by. Then, I went through the Diverging Diamond Interchange for the first time. I never made it 
farther than Exit 252 on I-25 in New Mexico until Thanksgiving 2016.
