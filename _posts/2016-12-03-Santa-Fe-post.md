Today, we drove to Santa Fe. We were supposed to go to Supercuts in Los Alamos today, but we're doing it tommorrow instead. We exchanged positions at Phillips 66 in San Ildefonso. I drove from Phillips 66 to The Home Depot in Santa Fe. We went to Panda Express for lunch. My Mom tried to looked for a bed comforter in all the stores, but she couldn't find the right size. She had to order online instead.
