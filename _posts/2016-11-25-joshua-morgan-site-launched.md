This is my first blog. Today, I drove from San Felipe Pueblo to Santa Fe. The police turned the sirens on and I pulled over. The police went by. Then, I drove through the Diverging Diamond Interchange for the first time. I have never driven farther than Exit 252 on I-25 in New Mexico until Thanksgiving 2016.
