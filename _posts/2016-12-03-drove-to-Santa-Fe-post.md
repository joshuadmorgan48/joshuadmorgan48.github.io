Today, we drive to Santa Fe. We were supposed to the Supercut in Los Alamos today, but we're doing it tommorrow instead. We exchange the position at Phillip 66. I drove from Phillip 66 to The Home Depot in Santa Fe. We had Panda Express for lunch. My Mom tryed to looked for the bed comfort in all the stores, but she couldn't find the right size. She had to order online instead.
